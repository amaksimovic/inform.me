INFORM.Me news portal is a project I did in May 2018. It was a final assignment of a PHP/Web development course I took up some time before. 

The idea of the assignment was to showace what we have learned in the course by making a website with a simple ADMIN AREA for ADDING/DELETING new articles, option for visitors to REGISTER, LOGIN, POST and DELETE their COMMENTS, and the possibility of SORTING articles by category. 

The project was done in procedural PHP, HTML and CSS.

Since I was testing my PHP skills, I didn't concern myself too much with the styling of the page so the look of it is pretty unremarkable. 

My front-end skills are better showcased in other projects on my github.
